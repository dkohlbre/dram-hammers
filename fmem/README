=== Modified from fmem 1.6.0 zip release ===

Added back in writing to memory.
This module is likely quite unsafe in its current form.

Original README below
----------------------

fmem 1.5.0

This module creates /dev/fmem device,
that can be used for dumping physical memory,
without limits of /dev/mem (1MB/1GB, depending on distribution)

Tested on i386 and x64, feel free to test it on
different architectures. (and send report please)

Cloned from linux/drivers/char/mem.c
(so GPL license apply)

Original name of this tool was fdump,
which was conflict with already existing tool,
so name was changed to fmem

Bug reports and patches welcome.

Usage:

$ make

# ./run.sh

# dd if=/dev/fmem of=... bs=1MB count=...

-----
BUGS: if you do something like # dd if=/dev/fmem of=dump
      dd will never stop, even if there is no more physical RAM
      on the system. This is more a feature, because Linux kernel
      don't have stable API, and detection of mapped areas can be
      tricky on older kernels. Because primary usage for fmem is
      memory forensic, I think it is safer to specify
      amount of RAM by hand.
